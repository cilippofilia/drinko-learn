Dick Bradsell is credited with revolutionizing the cocktail scene in London during that time, through his work at bars such as The Player, 6 Degrees, and Match, and the invention of the Bramble cocktail. The story goes that Bradsell created the drink when a young model asked for something to \"wake me up and fuck me up\". His solution was a combination of vodka, fresh espresso, coffee liqueur, and sugar, shaken into a frothy mix of bittersweet addiction."

Although many stories exist about the origins of the Zombie, it is likely that Donn himself was responsible for most of them.\n\nOne amusing but unlikely story is that the drink was invented for a businessman who needed help with his hangover and to get him through a tough meeting. The customer later reported back to Donn that he felt like the living dead, and said \"it made a zombie out of me\".\n\nFor many years, the recipe for the Zombie remained a mystery due to Donn's careful system of ingredient secrecy.

Cox, an American engineer who lived and worked in Cuba after the Spanish-American War, is believed to have invented the daiquiri after running out of gin while throwing a cocktail party. Since rum is plentiful in the country, it proved to be a convenient substitute in a punch he was serving. Unlike what is stated on his recipe card, the drink was made with limes and brown sugar. It turned out to be a huge hit, and Cox christened it the 'Daiquiri,' naming the drink after a nearby port town, which also happened to be where the U.S. first invaded Cuba during the Spanish-American War.\n\nHowever, considering the island's abundance of lime, sugar, and rum, it's likely that Cox was merely the first to pen the recipe of a cocktail that had already existed in Cuba. Not to mention that a prototype of the daiquiri had been saving the British Royal Navy from scurvy for centuries before.",

The inspiration for the title was apparently a 75mm Howitzer field gun used by the French and the Americans in World War I. The gun was known for its accuracy and speed, and the French 75 is said to have such a kick that it felt like being hit by just such a weapon. However, the cocktail’s history delves back further than the 1920s.
