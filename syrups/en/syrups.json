Store it in the fridge for more than a month. Most cocktails call for syrup because granulated sugar doesn't dissolve completely when stirred, shaken, or thrown. For drinks like the old fashioned, mojito, or caipirinha that originally call for granulated sugar, it's up to you whether to use granulated or syrup. However, using granulated sugar will make the sweetness of your cocktail evolve over time, which may not be desirable. By using sugar syrup instead, you'll have more control over the sweetness of the drink and it will be easier to replicate the exact same flavor profile."
