The method involves \"washing\" a spirit with a chosen fat – be it butter, bacon, or even olive oil – then freezing it to solidify the fat for removal, leaving behind only the desired flavors."

Imagine a smoky whiskey with a hint of bacon, perfect for a robust Old Fashioned, or a citrussy gin touched by the creamy subtleties of coconut oil, ready to bring a tropical twist to your martini.\n\nFat-washing not only exemplifies culinary ingenuity but also offers mixologists a canvas for creativity. The process respects the base spirit's integrity while layering complexity, making it a darling technique for craft cocktail creators who are eager to surprise and indulge the senses of their guests."

The interplay of scent and taste, coupled with an often unexpected silkiness, makes fat-washed spirits a novel exploration for the curious drinker and a tool for the visionary bartender.\n\nAs the craft cocktail movement continues to embrace traditional and modern techniques, fat-washing stands out as an innovative way to personalize and refine the essence of a drink. It is storytelling in a glass, where each sip reveals layers of flavor, inviting a journey through the senses that is as imaginative as it is delightful."

The acid causes the milk to curdle, separating the whey from the curds. The cocktail mixture is then slowly strained through the curds, which act as a filter. Over time, the curds capture many of the heavier elements that can cause cloudiness and harshness in the drink."

Milk clarification softens the edges of the spirits, mellows the acidity, and integrates the components in a way that simple mixing or shaking cannot achieve."
